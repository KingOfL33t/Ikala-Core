Ikala Core
=====
The core packages used by multiple Ikala projects.

A lot of major systems that do not need to be redone for each project are built and tested here, and used as a library in the projects.

The `Jars` directory contains output jars for the project. `ICore.jar` contains the source and required dependencies, `ICore-javadoc.jar` contains javadoc for the source, and `ICore-source.jar` contains source files for the code.

For more information about what this provides and how to use the components, please check out the wiki on github.
