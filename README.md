Ikala Core
=====

This is a framework for building modular plugin-based applications. This includes:

* An event management system which allows for an event system that is very simple and easy to use. 
* A plugin system that allows you to dynamically load/unload, and enable/disable plugins at run time. This allows you to split up functionality into bundles to easily handle the lifecycle of each part. It also integrates with the event system which allows better decoupling of different APIs.
* Some simple utilities to make tasks easier such as loading resources, getting system properties, and handling files.

The `dist` directory contains output jars for the project.
